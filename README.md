Animation of Kepler's equations in python

This educational program consists of three parts:

1. Prompting the user for the radius of the orbiting object

   *We'll start with simply prompting the user on the command line, and then we'll evolve through reading a parameter file and finally have a real User Interface with clicking and buttons and everything
2. Computing the orbital period of the orbiting object

   *Here we can start with the simple orbital period from the basic equation. From there we can move on to computing where the orbiter will be at time t, which we'll need for the animation
3. Creating an animation of this 

   *We can start with a simple 2D X-Y plot that refreshes, and we can move on to a 3D animation.
